# Title Case Kata
by Paula Muldoon 

### About
This kata is taken from [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5202ef17a402dd033c000009/train/haskell). I modified the instructions considerably in order to clarify ther requirements.

### The Brief
Write a function that converts a string into title case.  The string may be given in any combination of upper/lower case, eg:
- "THE MAN who MIStook hIS Wife for A HaT"
- "his dark materials"
- "PILLARS OF THE EARTH"

Title case means that each word in the string is either 
- capitalised ("Cold Comfort Farm")
- considered to be an exception and not capitalised ("Stars and Stripes Forever")
- the first word is always capitalised ("The Lord of the Rings")

The function may receive an optional list of exceptions. 

- the exceptions are given as a string with each word separated by a space ("a an the of")
- the exceptions should not be capitalised unless they start the title


###Arguments

First argument (required): the original string to be converted.
Second argument (optional): space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase except for the first word in the string. The JavaScript/CoffeeScript tests will pass undefined when this argument is unused.

###Examples

- ("a clash of KINGS", "a an the of") should return "A Clash of Kings"
- ("THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS", "The In") should return "The Wind in the Willows"
- ("the quick brown fox") should return "The Quick Brown Fox"
